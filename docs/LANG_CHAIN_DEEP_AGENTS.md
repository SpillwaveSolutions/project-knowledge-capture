# LangChain Deep Agents / Deep Agents Code

How to use **project-knowledge-capture** with LangChain Deep Agents and Deep Agents Code (`dcode`).

This package follows the open **Agent Skills** layout (`skills/*/SKILL.md`). Deep Agents loads the same format.

## Privacy and knowledge root

The institutional second brain is a local or private OKF tree the human already owns.

- Point Deep Agents at that tree with `SECOND_BRAIN_ROOT`.
- Never hard-code a remote URL or clone command.
- Public samples use only the in-repo `sample-knowledge/` graph.

## Install / discovery

### Filesystem skills source

```python
from deepagents import create_deep_agent
from deepagents.backends import FilesystemBackend

agent = create_deep_agent(
    model="...",
    backend=FilesystemBackend(root_dir=".", virtual_mode=True),
    skills=["./path/to/project-knowledge-capture/skills/"],
)
```

Or with SkillsMiddleware:

```python
from deepagents.middleware import SkillsMiddleware

SkillsMiddleware(
    backend=backend,
    sources=["/skills/", "/path/to/project-knowledge-capture/skills/"],
)
```

```bash
npx skills add SpillwaveSolutions/project-knowledge-capture --skill '*' --yes
```

This repo ships a root `plugin.json` conforming to https://agent-plugins.org.

Thin host wrapper: `hosts/deep-agents/SKILL.md`.

## Isolation

Deep Agents on one project worktree (for example **northstar-console**) must not write `main` of a shared brain directly.

```bash
python3 scripts/brain_session.py open \
  --repo "$BRAIN_REPO" \
  --bundle knowledge \
  --actor deep-agents/project-knowledge-capture \
  --plugin project-knowledge-capture \
  --host deep-agents
```

Then set `SECOND_BRAIN_ROOT` to the session bundle from the JSON. Close the session to PR. See [ISOLATION.md](ISOLATION.md).

## Deterministic capture

```bash
export SECOND_BRAIN_IDENTITY="deep-agents/project-knowledge-capture"
python3 scripts/pkc_pack.py features/user-authentication.md --bundle "${SECOND_BRAIN_ROOT:-sample-knowledge}" --hops 2
python3 scripts/pkc_validate.py --bundle "${SECOND_BRAIN_ROOT:-sample-knowledge}"
```

Wrap the scripts as tools or shell. The model proposes. The scripts capture, pack, materialize, and validate.

## Progressive disclosure

Startup sees skill frontmatter only. Pack (2 hops) before answering or writing.
